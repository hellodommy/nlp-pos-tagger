For/# six/CD years/NNS ,/, T./FW Marshall/FW Hahn/FW Jr./FW has/VBZ made/VBN corporate/JJ acquisitions/NNS in/IN the/DT George/FW Bush/FW mode/FW :/FW kind/FW and/FW gentle/FW ./. 
The/FW question/FW now/FW :/FW Can/FW he/FW act/FW more/FW like/FW hard-charging/FW Teddy/FW Roosevelt/FW ?/. 
Mr./UH Hahn/UH ,/, the/DT 62-year-old/JJ chairman/NN and/CC chief/JJ executive/NN officer/NN of/IN Georgia-Pacific/FW Corp./FW is/VBZ leading/VBG the/DT forest-product/JJS concern/NN 's/POS unsolicited/JJS $/$ 3.19/CD billion/CD bid/NN for/IN Great/FW Northern/FW Nekoosa/FW Corp/FW ./. 
Nekoosa/EX has/VBZ given/VBN the/DT offer/FW a/FW public/FW cold/FW shoulder/FW ,/FW a/FW reaction/FW Mr./FW Hahn/FW has/VBZ n't/RB faced/VBN in/IN his/PRP$ 18/CD earlier/JJR acquisitions/NNS ,/, all/DT of/IN which/WDT were/VBD negotiated/VBN behind/IN the/DT scenes/NNS ./. 
So/FW far/FW ,/FW Mr./FW Hahn/FW is/VBZ trying/VBG to/TO entice/FW Nekoosa/FW into/FW negotiating/FW a/FW friendly/FW surrender/FW while/FW talking/FW tough/FW ./. 
``/`` We/EX are/VBP prepared/VBN to/TO pursue/VB aggressively/PRP$ completion/NN of/IN this/DT transaction/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP says/VBZ ./. 
But/FW a/FW takeover/FW battle/FW opens/FW up/RP the/DT possibility/NN of/IN a/DT bidding/NN war/NN ,/, with/IN all/PDT that/DT implies/NN ./. 
If/PDT a/DT competitor/NN enters/VBZ the/DT game/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, Mr./FW Hahn/FW could/MD face/VB the/DT dilemma/NN of/IN paying/VBG a/DT premium/NN for/IN Nekoosa/NNP or/CC seeing/VBG the/DT company/NN fall/NN into/IN the/DT arms/NNS of/IN a/DT rival/NN ./.

``/`` There/EX 's/VBZ a/DT price/NN above/IN which/WDT I/FW 'm/FW positive/FW Marshall/FW has/VBZ the/DT courage/RBS not/RB to/TO pay/VB ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ A.D./UH Correll/UH ,/, Georgia-Pacific/NNP 's/POS executive/JJ vice/NN president/NN for/IN pulp/NN and/CC paper/NN ./.

He/VBP also/RB is/VBZ a/DT consensus/NN manager/NN ,/, insiders/WDT say/VBP ./. 
The/JJS decision/NN to/TO make/VB the/DT bid/NN for/IN Nekoosa/NNP ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, was/VBD made/VBN only/RB after/IN all/DT six/CD members/NNS of/IN Georgia-Pacific/FW 's/FW management/FW committee/FW signed/FW onto/FW the/FW deal/FW --/FW even/FW though/FW Mr./FW Hahn/FW knew/FW he/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO go/VB after/IN the/DT company/NN early/RB on/IN ,/, says/FW Mr./FW Correll/FW ./.
